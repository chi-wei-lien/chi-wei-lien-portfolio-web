&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi, I am Willy. I am a Junior studying Computer Science at [Purdue University](/education) from Taiwan. I have a strong interest in software development and enjoy learning low level system programming and machine learning.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some experience I have include my role as a research assistant at the [mobile artificial intelligence lab](https://polytechnic.purdue.edu/facilities/mobile-artificial-intelligence-laboratory). During that opportunity, I wrote and published a paper on Biometrics in [ACM computing survey](https://dl.acm.org/doi/full/10.1145/3603705) and worked closely with healthcare-related data, such as heart rate, to develop authentication models. In addition to my research and machine learning experience, my foundation in software development was strengthened during my internship at [120Water](https://120water.com/), a company dedicated to ensuring clean water for utilities. This experience allowed me to engage in both backend and frontend development, making me proficient in full-stack development using Typescript.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Outside of classes, I led the engineering team at Purdue Hackers Club, a CS club at Purdue where we help students from all backgrounds to learn more about computer science. Some of the projects that my team and I worked on include our official website, our official RESTful api, our rsvp system, and documentation website.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my downtime, I enjoy practicing magic card tricks, sketching, and creating educational [CS-focused YouTube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@loopholewilson). It is surprising and rewarding that I have built a small audience of people who enjoy what I share online. I am fully aware there is still so much to learn, and I am excited about the opportunities for growth in the future.
