&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hello, I am Willy, an enthusiastic international student from Taiwan who is currently pursuing a Computer Science degree at Purdue University. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over the past few years, I have found a strong interest in software engineering and machine learning. This curiosity led me to join a group at Purdue called Purdue Hackers, where we help fellow students tackle CS projects. This group has given me resources to work on my own projects and connect with others who share my interests. It has been a real pleasure leading its engineering team and watching my teammates come up with fascinating ideas.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My love for machine learning drove me to start exploring it more deeply. Last summer, I began my journey into CS research on biometric authentication, and I have been hooked ever since. Every time I discover something new, I can't wait to share it with others by writing papers.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my downtime, I enjoy practicing magic card tricks, sketching, and creating educational CS-focused YouTube videos. It is surprising and rewarding that I have built a small audience of people who enjoy what I share online. I am fully aware there is still so much to learn, and I am excited about the opportunities for growth in the future.
